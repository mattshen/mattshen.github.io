# Grown up in Jiangnan Area of China
---
Grown in the countryside in Huzhou, Zhejiang, I had quite a deep play on everyday life elements -- water, mud, fire, electicity etc, and had quite a lot fun with the animals - fishes, birds, fresh water lobster, cats, dogs etc. Then I went to Hangzhou - the city with the very beautiful West Lake - where I finished my study of Software Engineering in University, worked for three companies and started a family.

## Denver, Colorado, United States
On Dec 27, 2007, the first time I landed in Denver, US -- the amazing Mile-High city, sunny, snowy. I spent over a year during the three years with my second employer, when I had better chances to experience the American life and working style as well as opportunities to work some nice people.

## Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
The experience of living in US eventually made me seek opportunities to live overseas. After some research and a proper amount of efforts, I came to Sydney -- the sunny city with fantastic beaches.
