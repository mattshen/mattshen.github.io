# Grown up in Jiangnan Area of China
---
Grown in the countryside in Huzhou, Zhejiang, I had quite a deep play on eveyday life elements -- water, mud, fire, electicity etc, and had quite a lot fun with the animals - fishes, birds, fresh water lobster, cats, dogs etc. Then I went to Hangzhou - the city with the very beautiful West Lake - where I finished my study in Uni, worked for three companies and started a family.

# Intrigued by the world outside of China

## Denver, Colorado, United States
On Dec 27, 2007, the first time I landed in Denver, US -- the amazing mile-high city. There are a couple of keywords for that city -- sunny, snowy, big flat lands, etc. I spend over a year during the 3 years with my 2nd employer when I had better chances to experience the American life and work style.
