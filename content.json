Intrigued by the world outside of ChinaDenver, Colorado, United StatesOn Dec 27, 2007, the first time I landed in Denver, US – the amazing Mile-High city, sunny, snowy. I spent over a year during the three years with my second employer, when I had better chances to experience the American life and working style as well as opportunities to work some nice people. Sydney, New South Wales, AustraliaThe experience of living in US eventually made me seek opportunities to live overseas. After some research and a proper amount of efforts, I came to Sydney – the sunny city with fantastic beaches."},{"title":"Categories","date":"2017-03-18T08:09:30.000Z","updated":"2017-03-18T08:09:30.000Z","comments":true,"path":"categories/index.html","permalink":"https://mattshen.mazeforce.com/categories/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"Tags","date":"2017-03-18T08:09:39.000Z","updated":"2017-03-18T08:09:39.000Z","comments":true,"path":"tags/index.html","permalink":"https://mattshen.mazeforce.com/tags/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""}],"posts":[{"title":"Javascript the types (Nouns and Verbs)","slug":"Javascript-Re-learn-the-types","date":"2017-03-19T23:02:00.000Z","updated":"2017-04-01T11:30:03.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/03/20/Javascript-Re-learn-the-types/","link":"","permalink":"https://mattshen.mazeforce.com/2017/03/20/Javascript-Re-learn-the-types/","excerpt":"","text":"The reasonThis is the first post of a series of Javascript re-learn posts. Why am I writing it when there are some many similar stuff out on Internet? If there has to be a reason, the first one would be to review my knowledge on Javascript and hopefully I can get some level of “学而时习之,可以为师矣”. TypesOne of the best ways to learn a programming language is to think like I’m going to design it. Just like the natural languages, first we need to properly express the things in nouns, like apple, orange, etc. As an advanced programming language, Javascript’s types are properly designed, not too simple not too complex. It starts with Number, then String and Boolean. Then a little more complex, Object and Function. And that’s all, not too overwhelming for beginners to start with. NumberRather that some other languages, e.g. Java, with which the programmer has to remember Integer, Long, Float, Double, BigDecimal and BigInteger, etc, Javascript relieves the beginners from this burden. All numbers start with Type Number. StringAfter much pain with C, most programming language designers have added String as a primitive type ever since, which is proved to be the very right thing to do. BooleanBoolean is not necessary to be a primitive, e.g. C. But defining a Boolean type has been well accepted. It makes the readability of the program better. see following negative example: 1234567int a = 0; //Then change a to some other valueif (a) &#123; // do something if expression \"a\" is true //do something&#125; To be honest, after so many years, I still have to google to find out whether 0 is true or non-0 is true. ObjectWhen Javascript is designed, OOP is already well accepted. So the author adopted some OOP into the language. But probably he doesn’t like the complexities of OOP – classes, interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, etc. So he just pick one very simple concept, the Object, to express all the different real life things, just like he picked only Number to express all the numbers. FunctionImagine (脑洞大开) the first human beings who invented the word “apple”, then they can use it communicate with their peers. But soon after that, they would have the need to express “pick” and “eat”. In the programming languages, “pick” and “eat” are functions. Once programmers have objects, they would need functions to operate on the objects. Unlike some languages like Java (sorry), Javascript’s functions can work independently. They are first-class citizens just like objects. This little difference opens the door for Javascript to become a proper player in the functional programming area.","categories":[{"name":"Programming Languages","slug":"Programming-Languages","permalink":"https://mattshen.mazeforce.com/categories/Programming-Languages/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Javascript","slug":"Javascript","permalink":"https://mattshen.mazeforce.com/tags/Javascript/"},{"name":"Type","slug":"Type","permalink":"https://mattshen.mazeforce.com/tags/Type/"}]},{"title":"Java 8 Lambda Expression in Short","slug":"Java-8-Lambda-Expression-in-Short","date":"2016-05-07T14:00:00.000Z","updated":"2017-04-01T11:15:06.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/05/08/Java-8-Lambda-Expression-in-Short/","link":"","permalink":"https://mattshen.mazeforce.com/2016/05/08/Java-8-Lambda-Expression-in-Short/","excerpt":"","text":"Anonymous class in a new formSimply speaking, Java 8 Lambda expressions are just anonymous classes which have occasionally made their appearances in the previous Java versions. But now they appears in much more concise forms with the new syntactic level support. Here are a couple of examples how concise we can archive in Java coding with the help of lambda expression. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223//Anonymous classCollections.sort(names, new Comparator&lt;String&gt;() &#123; @Override public int compare(String o1, String o2) &#123; return o1.compareTo(o2); &#125;&#125;);//Java 8 Lambda expression in complete Collections.sort(names, (String o1, String o2) -&gt; &#123; return o1.compareTo(o2);&#125;);//Parameter type can be omitted, because the types can be inferredCollections.sort(names, (o1, o2) -&gt; &#123; return o1.compareTo(o2);&#125;);//return can be omitted for one line lambdaCollections.sort(names, (o1, o2) -&gt; o1.compareTo(o2));//method reference can make it even shorterCollections.sort(names, String::compareTo); Default method is necessary for lambdasWith anonymous classes, it is possible to define a new utility method, e.g. 12345678910//Anonymous classCollections.sort(names, new Comparator&lt;String&gt;() &#123; @Override public int compare(String o1, String o2) &#123; return o1.compareTo(o2); &#125; public Comparator&lt;String&gt; reversed() &#123; return Collections.reverseOrder(this); &#125;&#125;); But the utility method cannot fit into a concise lambda. This is why Java 8 has made default methods possible in interfaces. The example above can now be re-written in Java 8 as follow:1Collections.sort(names, ((Comparator&lt;String&gt;)String::compareTo).reversed()); Note: the type casting is necessary, because type inference is not that smart in that context. Using functional features rather than being functionalThe introduction of lambda and the re-written interfaces/classes makes Java 8 look like functional programming language. But as a matter of fact, it is not. Type is still the the first-class citizen, not functions. Everything in Java is still type of either predefined types or primitives. Passing lambdas around is actually just passing usual objects around. However, this is what is needed for most of the Java developers – writing concise code as well as thinking in a functional programming way.
